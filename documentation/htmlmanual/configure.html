<P>The configure utility is responsible for making sure you have all necessary
programs for compiling and installing TONTO, and for automatically setting
compiler settings for compilers it knows about.

<P>There are several problems you may encounter when using configure, which are
listed below.
Examples of the output which <I>may</I> occur are also given.

<UL>
<P>
<LI>Configure dies, complaining about a missing program.
<DIR>
<PRE>
checking for perl... no
configure: error: perl not found - cannot continue
</PRE>
</DIR>
<P>Download the offending program and run configure again.  See the "<A
HREF="install.html#need">Requirements for TONTO</A>" section for where to
download it from.

<P>If you do have this program installed but configure cannot find it, then it
is not in your search path.  Ask your system administrator on how to adjust
your search path to find it.
</LI>

<P>
<LI>Configure states that it is using default options for your compiler.
<DIR>
<PRE>
Your site_config file is ./site_config/UNKNOWN-LINUX
I do not know the settings for your compiler, using defaults.
You will need to edit this file, then rerun configure.
See the documentation for more information.
</PRE>
</DIR>
<P>You are using an unknown compiler, and we have not yet written an
appropriate file in the site_config directory.  Configure will create this file
for you and put default entries in it.  You will have to edit and fix this file
(note the name of the file from the configure output), and then rerun
configure.  See the <A HREF="site_config.html">site_config</A> documentation on
the contents of this file.

<P>If you do have a case where you have to write a new site_config file, please
send it to us so that we can include it in the distribution.
</LI>

<P>
<LI>Configure cannot find your compiler.
<DIR>
<PRE>
checking Fortran compiler
checking for f95... no
checking for f90... no
checking for frt... no
checking for xlf90... no
checking for g95... no
checking for g90... no
configure: warning: No fortran compiler found!
configure: warning: Skipping library checks.
</PRE>
</DIR>
<P>The easiest solution is to rename or copy your compiler to f95 in the same
directory as the compiler, and run configure again.
<P>If the default name of the compiler is something that configure does not
know, please let us know and we will update configure to find it.

</LI>
</UL>

<P>If the above problems and solutions do not apply to you, please write to us
and we will try to help.
