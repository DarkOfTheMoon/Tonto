All you have to do to compile Tonto is:
<DIR>gunzip -c tonto.tar.gz | tar xvf -
<BR>cd tonto
<BR>./configure
<BR>make install</DIR>

You may have to add a file in the site_config directory for your system.
"configure" will complain and tell you if you have to do this.  If required,
copy the template file to whatever name configure tells you, and edit it to
suit your compiler.  You will probably need to add a C preprocessor flag to the
FFLAGS line.  The FFAST, FPROF, and FDEBUG lines are probably not ideal or
correct - consult your Fortran compiler manual.

<BR><BR>
<H6>configure options</H6>
There is only one option that can be passed to configure, which is --bindir,
which is where you want the executable installed when you type "make install".
The default is --bindir=/usr/local/bin.

<BR><BR>
<H6>Makefile options</H6>
You can type "make help" for common commands to pass to make.  For example,
"make documentation" will build the HTML documentation from the source code.
<BR><BR>
You can also edit the Makefile and set the F90 variable.  Useful things to
put after the "F90 =" are $(FFAST), $(FDEBUG), and $(FPROF).  These options
are passed to the compiler as well as the default options.  You can leave
it blank if you want, but most people probably want "F90 = $(FFAST)".  The
$(FPROF) is used by developers for timing parts of programs.

<H4>Compiler specific issues</H4>

<DIR>
Compaq Fortran 5.3 for TRU64 and OSF/1

<ul>
<li>
Use build 1120 of the compiler, the original could not handle the large number
of modules.  You can download the patch for free from the Compaq web site.</li>
</ul>
</DIR>

<DIR>
Digital Fortran 5.0 for OSF/1

<ul>
<li>
run time libraries 376 or later must be used.  Before this, the "for_cpusec"
routine will be unresolved.</li>

<li>
in macros file, must have:</li>

<br>
<DIR><DIR>
#define DEFAULT_NULL<br>
</DIR></DIR>
This is a compiler bug.<BR>
The "configure" script should set this automatically.
</ul>

Fujitsu Fortan for Linux

<ul>
<li>
patch 1999/07/29 or later of the Compiler must be used , the original could not
handle the large number of modules.</li>

<li>
in macros file, must have:</li>

<br>
<DIR><DIR>
#define DEFAULT_NULL => NULL()<br>
</DIR></DIR>
This is standard Fortran.<BR>
The "configure" script should set this automatically.</ul>
