because it does not have a &#8220;<span class="quote">main program</span>&#8221; (although for convenience
a few common &#8220;<span class="quote">main programs</span>&#8221; are already set up for you to use).
Instead, TONTO consists of about fifty independent modules.  In most cases the
more sophisticated modules will make use of the simpler ones.  Once compiled,
however, each single module can be used separately, in its own right. It is the
documentation for each of these modules which appears on the TONTO
homepage.</P><P>The module which probably will be used most often is
<tt class="literal">MOL</tt>, since it contains routines which deal with the
&#8220;<span class="quote">molecule data type</span>&#8221;.  The executable, or &#8220;<span class="quote">main
program</span>&#8221; associated with this module is called
<tt class="literal">run_mol.x</tt>. Indeed, the executable associated with any module
with name <tt class="literal">XXXX</tt> is, by convention, always called
<tt class="literal">run_xxxx.x</tt>.</P><P>Each module in TONTO is organised so that it is concerned only with
tasks which deal with a specific data type.  For example, the module
<tt class="literal">REALMAT</tt> deals with the data type &#8220;<span class="quote">matrices of real
numbers</span>&#8221;, and consists of routines, such as
<tt class="literal">swap_columns</tt> or <tt class="literal">solve_eigenproblem</tt>, which
only deal with matrices.  That is, their first argument is always a matrix of
real numbers.</P><P>More complicated modules are designed around Fortran95 derived data types.
For example, the &#8220;<span class="quote">molecule data type</span>&#8221; which is used in module
<tt class="literal">MOL</tt>  is built from a collection of items, called
<span class="emphasis"><em>components</em></span>, of a simpler data type.  There is one component
called <tt class="literal">name</tt> of &#8220;<span class="quote">string type</span>&#8221; which holds the
name of the molecule. There is also another component called
<tt class="literal">atom</tt>, which is a vector.  Each element of this vector is of
&#8220;<span class="quote">atom type</span>&#8221;, and holds information about each of the atoms which
make up the molecule.  Each of the routines in module <tt class="literal">MOL</tt>
(for example, <tt class="literal">center_of_mass</tt>, which returns the center of
mass of the molecule) always takes as its first argument, a variable of the
molecule data type.</P><P>The style of module programming used in TONTO is known as abstract data
type programming, or more loosely, object based programming.</P><P>This style of module was chosen because we believe it has a simplicity of
structure and ease of modification which was one of the main design goals of
TONTO. </P></div><div class="navfooter"><IMG SRC="../hr.png" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100%"><BR><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="tonto-design.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="writing-programs.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="foo.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The design of TONTO </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The foo language in TONTO</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
