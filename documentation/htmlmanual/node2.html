What is <TT>TONTO</TT>???</A>
</H1>

<P>
<TT>TONTO</TT>  is a free computer package for doing quantum chemistry calculations.

<P>
The name <TT>TONTO</TT>  was suggested by Anthony Russell, and means ``fool''
in Spanish.

<P>
The main objective of <TT>TONTO</TT> is to be <EM>simple</EM>--simple to understand, 
simple to use, and most importantly, <EM>simple to hack</EM>. However, because
quantum chemical calculations are time consuming, efficiency is also an
important issue; but efficiency is not more important than simplicity,
for <TT>TONTO</TT>.

<P>
<TT>TONTO</TT> is intended for quantum chemists with new ideas, but who are extremely 
frustrated by the time it takes to understand and modify older, monolithic 
quantum chemistry packages to do what they want. <TT>TONTO</TT> is not for people who want 
to crank out the papers.  If you want to do that, go and buy Gaussian or 
Spartan or HyperChem or ADF.  <TT>TONTO</TT> is for the people who can't get these 
packages to do exactly what they want.  <TT>TONTO</TT> is for the people who mainly write code.

<P>
<TT>TONTO</TT> is copyleft under the less restrictive
<A HREF="lgpl.html">GNU library licence</A>. 

<P>
If you want features added or corrected in <TT>TONTO</TT>, you can do it yourself
and mail the new stuff to us! Your code contributions will be very much appreciated. 

<P>
<TT>TONTO</TT> has been implemented in <TT>foo</TT>, an object oriented Fortran preprocessor
which translates into Fortran95. <TT>Foo</TT> stands for object oriented Fortran
in reverse. The main facility that <TT>foo</TT> allows is a dot notation to represent
message passing between ``objects'' and ``methods'', as used in many object oriented languages.
In <TT>foo</TT>, the dot stands for a routine call or a structure component separator, 
depending on the context. For example,
<PRE>
   a.b   means   call b(a)
    .b   means   call b(self),  or   self%b
</PRE><TT>Foo</TT> also does a number of other minor things, like eliminating the need 
to use <TT>subroutine</TT> or <TT>function</TT> keywords, and the ability to use 
the <TT>end</TT> keyword to replace all control-flow terminators, 
like <TT>end do</TT>, <TT>end if</TT>, <TT>end subroutine</TT>, <TT>end function</TT>, etc ...

<P>
In the following parts of this document we go into the issues which affected
the design of <TT>TONTO</TT> and <TT>foo</TT>, and also the specifications.
The <TT>foo</TT> preprocessor is still under development, and 
preconditions and inheritance via code inclusion are planned.

<P>
If you wish to skip directly to view the code, the frame bar of the left will take you to
the documentation for each of the available modules, which each encapsulates
an abstract data type used in quantum chemical calculations. The documentation
is generated directly from the <TT>foo</TT> code via the <TT>foo2html</TT> converter,
and consists of a synopsis section and a list of routine specifications.
