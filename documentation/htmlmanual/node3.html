Philosophical motivation ...</A>
</H1>

<P>
It is our view that the great advances in computer software that have been
made over the last decades are due largely to the free exchange
of ideas and information, including the availability of good
free software. It is also our belief that the lack of cooperation
between researchers in the field of quantum chemistry has had a
deleterious effect on the important role that quantum chemistry should be
taking in chemistry, physics and engineering. 

<P>
We hope that if you are a user and programmer, you will consider
developing your ideas within this framework and that you will share
your work. Hopefully, the code will evolve and be corrected by the user community.

<P>
Suggestions and comments will always be appreciated!
