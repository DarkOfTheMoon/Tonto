<H1><A NAME="diff">How is TONTO different from other packages?</A></H1>

<P>TONTO is not just another computational chemistry package; it also provides
an environment that makes code development a simple task.  The modular form of
TONTO makes its use logical and its input simple.

<P>TONTO has been implemented in <TT>foo</TT>, an object oriented preprocessor
which currently translates into Fortran95<A NAME="foot1a"
HREF="#foot1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.  <TT>Foo</TT> makes the process of maintaining
and documenting the TONTO system automatic. In particular, the online html
documentation is generated directly from the code. 

<P>TONTO can perform many tasks in quantum crystallography.  The aim of this
field is to derive accurate molecular wavefunctions by incorporating x-ray,
polarised neutron, or other diffraction and scattering data directly into the
method for determining the wavefunction.

<P>There is no guarantee that TONTO will remain translated into Fortran95.  A
translation into C++, or more likely another object oriented language, would
also be relatively easy and may be required at a later date in the event that
Fortran ceases to be the best option for fast code.  Thus, the lifespan of code
written in TONTO can be expected to be quite long.

<P>The best feature of TONTO is that it is free. The modules of TONTO can be
used without modification in your own work, <EM>commercial or otherwise</EM><A

<DT><A NAME="foot1" HREF="#foot1a"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<TT>Foo</TT> stands for object oriented Fortran in reverse, since true object
orientation is not really possible in Fortran just yet.

However, if you modify the routines you can only distribute the modified work
with your own under the terms of the GNU library license.
