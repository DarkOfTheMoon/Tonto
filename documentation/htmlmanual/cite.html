<H1><A NAME="cite">Citing TONTO</A></H1>

<P>It is important to always cite the author who first described the algorithm
which is used by TONTO to do a particular calculation.  References to
algorithms used in TONTO are given in this manual, and may be presented as
output from some calculations.

<P>You should cite TONTO if you are writing a paper which has modified parts of
TONTO, and deals with aspects of efficiency or implementation, or if you are
writing a paper about the construction of large computational chemistry
programs, since TONTO is probably the only example of an object oriented
Fortran computational chemistry system in existence.
