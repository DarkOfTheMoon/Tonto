The role of a preprocessor</A>
</H2>

<P>
The problem of inheritance in Fortran can be easily solved by using a
<EM>preprocessor</EM>. Additional advantages of using a
preprocessor is that the user can be encouraged into adopting
an object oriented programming style from the outset.
Using a preprocessor may also facilitate translation of the
code into other languages, or protect against changes in the
existing language. This latter point is a consideration for Fortran95, 
since a new standard is to be released in the year 2001, 
and will incorporate inheritance features. Finally, a preprocessor
can protect against platform-specific problems and aid portability.
