<H1><A NAME="inst">Installing TONTO on a known system</A></H1>

<P>The steps for installing TONTO on a known system are described below.<BR>

<P> The example given is for someone running the Fujitsu compiler on Linux, and
will install the source code in /usr/local/src/tonto, and the executable in
/usr/local/bin.

<P>If you encounter any problems, send us an e-mail: we would like to know.  We
cannot guarantee to help, but we will try.  Some insight into problems that may
occur are described in the section below.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Decide on a place for the TONTO source code.  This may be your home
directory ~, or it may be a place where you usually place program sources, like
/usr/local/src.  A directory called "tonto" will be created in this place, which
will contain the source code and documentation.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>cd /usr/local/src
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you do not have the source code, it can be downloaded from
<BR><TT>http://www.theochem.uwa.edu.au/tonto/</TT>.<BR>
Copy the downloaded file tonto.tar.gz into the directory you have just changed
to.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>cp ~/tonto.tar.gz .
</UL>

<P>
<LI>Uncompress and untar the file tonto.tar.gz.<BR>
(You will need the GNU free software program called gunzip)

<P>
<UL>
<LI>gunzip -c tonto.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</UL>

<P>
<LI>Change to the "tonto" directory.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>cd tonto
</UL>

<P>
<LI>There should now be a few files and directories, such as configure,
Makefile.in, foofiles, and documentation.  Run the "configure" script to set up
the TONTO compilation to run on your machine.  At this stage, you can tell it
where you want the executables installed, via the --bindir= option to configure.
See the <A HREF="configure.html">configure</A> section for more details or 
if there are any errors.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>./configure --bindir=/usr/local/bin

Your site_config file is ./site_config/FUJITSU-LINUX
You may want to edit this file, but it should work as is.
See the documentation for more information.

Next, type "make install"

<P>
<LI>Using an editor program, have a look at your site_config file and make sure
it is correct.  The name of this file is given to you whenever you run
configure.  If you change this file, be sure to run configure again, otherwise
continue to the next step.

<P>

</pre>
</DIR>

</LI>

<P>
<LI>If you wish to use TONTO's debugging or memory checking facilities, then
edit the macros file.  This is described <A HREF="macros.html">here</A>.  Most
users should probably skip this step, as the default configuration does not use
these.
</LI>

<P>
<LI>The configuration part is now complete.<BR>
In the instructions below, if your make program is called gmake, substitute the
word "make" for "gmake".<BR>

<P>To compile and install the main executable, type "make install".<BR>
The main executable for TONTO, run_mol.x, will be compiled and installed into
the /usr/local/bin directory (or the alternative directory if you ran configure
with the --bindir= option).

<P>To build the documentation, type "make documentation".<BR>
To see the documentation use your browser to open the file
"documentation/index.html".
