<H1>How do we achieve the aims of <TT>TONTO</TT>?</H1>

<P>
To achieve the goal of simplicity means that
the logical structure of <TT>TONTO</TT>  must be clearly expressed and divided 
into self contained units.  Any changes that might be required for <TT>TONTO</TT>  are 
then performed on isolated logical sub-units which do not disrupt the 
program as a whole. A by-product of such an approach is that <TT>TONTO</TT> 
can easily evolve to cope with, and take advantage of, 
the rapid changes in computer hardware and software that are the
norm today.

<P>
Of course, the design of a program into logically separate subunits is
a general requirement for any programming task. The most significant 
choice that affects the logical design of the program, and
its efficiency, (i.e. the two stated goals)
is the choice of programming launguage. For numerical applications,
there are really only two possibilities which are popular
enough to be considered--Fortran95 or C/C++. 

<P>
In the next section the choices are compared, but to cut a long story short,
we used Fortran coupled with a preprocessor. It's simpler and more robust
than C++.
