<H1><A NAME="intro">TONTO Installation Introduction</A></H1>

<P>If your Fortran compiler and operating system is known to us, you are in
luck.  TONTO has been compiled and tested on it, and the installation is very
easy.

<P>The set of known systems is given in the next section.

<P>In addition, you will need a number of free software tools, which are also
listed in the next section.

<P>If your system is not known to us, you can look at the section entitled
<A HREF="problems.html">Problems installing TONTO</A>. Except for
<A HREF="problems.html#compspec">compiler bugs</A>, it should still be
straightforward to get TONTO to work.  We are always interested in porting our
code to your system; please contact us.

<P>If you own a Silicon Graphics machine, TONTO will not work.  At the current
time, the Silicon Graphics Fortran95 compiler cannot be made to work for the
style of programming that we use.

<H1><A NAME="need">Requirements for compiling TONTO</A></H1>

<P>You will need a Fortran 95 conforming compiler.<BR>
The set of compilers and operating systems on which TONTO has been tested is:

<UL>
<LI>Fujitsu frt compiler under UXP5
</LI>
<LI>Fujitsu frt compiler under LINUX
</LI>
<LI>NAG f95 compiler under LINUX
</LI>
<LI>IBM xlf compiler under AIX
</LI>
<LI>DEC f95 compiler under OSF1
</LI>
<LI>Compaq f95 compiler under TRU64 unix
</LI>
<LI>Sun frt compiler
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Apart from a Fortran compiler, you will need the following free software:

<UL>
<LI>Netscape or another web browser to view the documentation.
</LI>
<LI>the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html">GNU</A> utilites
