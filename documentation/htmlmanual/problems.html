<P>If you have read the following sections on possible problems and solutions
and are still stuck, then feel free to ask us to help with your problems.
<BR>We cannot guarantee to help, but we will try.

<P>There are a few problems you may experience in getting TONTO to work:

<UL>
<LI>The configure script cannot find programs, or does not recognise your
compiler.</LI>
<LI>The Fortran compiler complains while trying to compile TONTO.
</LI>
</UL>
Detailed information to help you with these separate issues is given in
following sections. However, the first step is to decide which of the problems
you have.

<P>If the problem occurs while running the configure script, then see the
<A HREF="configure.html">configure</A> documentation.

<P>Problems with the compiler are indicated by messages which involve the
Fortran compiler (say, f95 or ftn90), and may mention errors involving words or
phrases like subroutine, incorrect syntax, or undeclared variable.  Usually, a
line of Fortran code will also be printed.  See the <A
HREF="compilers.html">compilers</A> section.

Compaq Fortran 5.3 for TRU64 and OSF/1
 
<ul>
<li>use build 1120 of the compiler or later, the original requires too much
memory.  <BR>You can download the patch for free from the Compaq web site.</li>
</ul></DIR>
 
<DIR>Digital Fortran 5.0 for OSF/1
 
<ul><li>run time libraries 376 or later must be used.
<BR>Before this, the "for_cpusec" routine will be unresolved.</li>
 
<li>in the macros file, must have:</li>

This is a compiler bug.
<BR>The "configure" script should detect and fix this automatically.</ul>
