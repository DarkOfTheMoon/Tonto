<H2>The choice of language</H2>

<P>
C++ seems the obvious choice since it is an object oriented
language, and the goal of a program with simple self contained logical sub-units 
is most easily achieved with an object-oriented language. The unique features 
of an object-oriented language that facilitate logical design are the ability to define and use
<EM>abstract data types</EM> in which the internal implementation and algorithms are
<EM>hidden</EM> or <EM>encapsulated</EM>; 
and the ability to <EM>inherit</EM> or <EM>reuse</EM> old code in new contexts.

<P>
Fortran95 is not a true object oriented language, but it does have
the facility tio define abstract data types. However, an inheritance mechanism
is missing. The main advantages of Fortran95 over C++ for numerical work are:
<UL>
<LI>It has a powerful inbuilt array handling syntax
<LI>It has an inbuilt complex data type
<LI>It has good aliasing properties for pointers, and good expression re-arrangement properties
<LI>It has a tradition of providing highly optimized compilers for heavy numerical computation
<LI>It is an internationally standardized parallel SIMD and MIMD programming language
<LI>It is fully backwards compatible with Fortran77, so legacy code can be used
</UL>
<P>
The lack of any built-in inheritance mechanism in Fortran95 is also not so serious
as it first looks. Provided a few simple coding styles are adhered to, inheritance can be 
implemented by hand by explicitly including old code. Minor modifications
of the old code are required to deal with new types and routine
calls. These modifications can be achieved with a single search-substitute command in
an editor. The exact manner in which this is done  should become clear
in the next section.
