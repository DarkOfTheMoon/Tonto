preprocessor language called <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>. This language is essentially a terse form of
Fortran95. Indeed, it currently translates into Fortran95.</P><P>The <tt class="literal">foo</tt> language has been adopted for two
reasons.</P><P>The first reason is because the object based paradigm is easily expressed
in the <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> language. A dot notation has been introduced which blurs the
distinction between a routine and a derived type component. This makes it very
flexible to further change. TONTO has already been written from the ground up
about four times.  There are other advantages when using <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> which involve the
automation of a few laborious tasks associated with object based
programmming---for example the automated generation of interface definitions or
overloaded names.</P><P>The second reason to use <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> is because the documentation can easily be
extracted from the code. Indeed, the code is intended to be self documenting
(although in practice this is entirely dependent on the discipline of the
programmer).</P><P>We have chosen to use Fortran95 as the base language in recognition of its
its tradition of providing highly optimizing compilers for heavy numerical
computation. This tradition is due in part to Fortran's good aliasing properties
for pointers, and to favourable expression re-arrangement properties. Another
significant reason for using Fortran95 is that it is backwards compatible with
Fortran77, so the significant existing body of old code can be used as a
starting point, and then gradually replaced.  Fortran95 also has some very
elegant built-in array manipulation mechanisms which are not available, or not
so elegant, in other languages.</P><P>We have chosen to use a preprocessor because we believe that the code will
then be more robust and portable. In particular, it is hoped that algorithms
written in <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> will be language independent.</P><P>While we have chosen to use a preprocessor in our system, we do not desire
to force people to use it. The system is flexible enough to allow standard
Fortran programming, or linking to other Fortran programs.</P></div><div class="navfooter"><IMG SRC="../hr.png" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100%"><BR><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="tonto-modules.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="writing-programs.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="documentation-style.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Modules in TONTO </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The documentation and style in TONTO</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
