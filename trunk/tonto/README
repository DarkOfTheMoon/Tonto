Welcome to Tonto!

---------------
Compiling Tonto
---------------

To compile Tonto, type :

   perl -w Makefile.pl
   make

If you want a specific compiler, type:

   perl -w Makefile.pl -fc=<insert-your-compiler-here>
   make

where you should replace <insert-your-comipler-here> with your
specific compiler.

----------------------
Running the test suite
----------------------

To run the test suite, type:

   make tests

---------------------------------
Where to find example input files
---------------------------------

Look in the directories in the tests/ directory for example input files.
The example inputs are called "stdin" and the example outputs are
called "stdout"

----------------
How to run a job
----------------

Make an input file called "stdin", or copy one of those you like from 
the directories within the tests/ directory, then type:

   ./<your-compiler-on-your-OS>/run_molecule.exe

where <your-compiler-on-your-OS> is the directory appropriate for your
platform, which is created automatically when you compile Tonto.

-----------------------------
How to make the documentation
-----------------------------

To make the documentation, type:

   make documentation

then point your browser at documentation/index.html.  The hyperlinked code
documentation is generated from the source code, so it is up to date, but 
the text documentation is a bit out of date.
