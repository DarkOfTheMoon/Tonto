This is the program that you need to run to build the Makefile.  It checks to
see whether you have the necessary programs to compile Tonto, and whether you
have some version of the Lapack/Blas libraries too.

The only useful option to this is --bindir=/some/path, the default is
--bindir=/usr/local/bin which should suffice for most users.

To run configure, just type "./configure".

If configure complains about a missing file in the site_config directory, you
will need to create that file with your compiler specific options in it.  You
can get an idea of what to do from the other files in the directory.  If you
do create a new file for your system, please send us a copy so we can add it
to the source.

The full script is <A HREF="configure">configure</A>, although most people
don't need to look at it.  It is produced from <A
HREF="configure.in">configure.in</A> file using autoconf.  The Makefile.in file
is used by configure as a template for the Makefile, along with the files in
the site_config directory.  Configure may change the macros file, as there is
a bug in the earlier DEC compilers that does not allow initialisation of
pointers to NULL().
