<H2>Motivation for the critical requirements</H2>

<P>
The reason for having the module name introduced as a prestring for the
module routine is to prevent namespace pollution. For example, the routine
<TT>get_item</TT> may be a common possibility for a routine name; using the
module name as a prefix prevents any possible name clash, if a list
of unique module names is maintained. Similarly, the provision of a generic interface
with an underscore as the first character (e.g. <TT>_get_item</TT>) also
prevents namespace pollution with any local variables with the same name. 
In addition, the provision of a generic
interface means that other modules may deliberately re-use the name of the routine without a name conflict. 
This possibility of <EM>overloading</EM> the same generic name by different modules should 
be employed whenever the overloaded routine name performs a similar function in the different modules.

Inheritance. Suppose <TT>MAT</TT> and <TT>CMAT</TT> are two modules which describe
matrices of real and complex numbers, respectively. The same generic
interface name <TT>_product</TT> might be used in both modules to describe
a routine which returns the product of two matrices, whether real or complex.
If every procedure in <TT>MAT</TT> had a corresponding procedure in
<TT>CMAT</TT> with the same generic name, any code written initially 
using real matrices is trivially extended to complex matrices by changing
the string <TT>MAT</TT> to <TT>CMAT</TT> in the program code.
