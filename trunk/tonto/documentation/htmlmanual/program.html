<H1><A NAME="need">What do I need to program in TONTO?</A></H1>

<P>You will need to know how to program in Fortran95 in a Unix environment.  In
addition, it will be helpful (but certainly not necessary) to be familiar with
the object oriented programming paradigm.

<P>As well as knowing how to use TONTO, you will need to know how TONTO is
structured, as described in Chapter 4, and also why it has the structure it
does. With this knowledge you can modify TONTO for your requirements. 

<P>Although you can program in Fortran, it is highly recommended for TONTO that
you learn how to program in the <TT>foo</TT> language.  <TT>Foo</TT> is easy to
learn, and makes many routine tasks associated with TONTO automatic, and in
addition your code will automatically be documented and checked for memory
leaks, if you desire.  The <TT>foo</TT> language is described in Chapter 5.

<P>To make good use of existing code, you will need to be familiar with the
code that is already there.  This is described in Chapter 6.

<H1><A NAME="contribute">Contributing code to TONTO</A></H1>

<P>Remember, TONTO is copyleft under the less restrictive GNU library license.
It is free software.

<P>If you want features added or corrected in TONTO, you can do it yourself and
mail the new stuff to us.  If you intend to make major and continual additions,
it may be better to use the CVS repository.  This allows many programmers to
work on the code at the same time, while minimising the effects on others.
Either way, your code contributions will be very much appreciated. 

<P>Of course, your rights as a contributing author are protected under the GNU
license.

<P>You can find out more of the underlying philosophy and aspirations of the
TONTO project in the final chapter of this manual.
