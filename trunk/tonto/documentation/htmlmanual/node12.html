<H1>The <TT>foo</TT> preprocessor language</H1>

<P>
The <TT>foo</TT> preprocessor language is used to encourage an object-oriented
programming style. The acronym <TT>foo</TT> stands for ``object oriented fortran''
in reverse, because fortran itself is not really designed for true object-orientation.
The Fortran95 code that the <TT>foo</TT> preprocessor emits conforms to
the critical and aesthetic requirements described in the previous section.
The input to the <TT>foo</TT> preprocessor is a terse form of Fortran95
which eliminates the tedium of conforming to the aforementioned requirements,
e.g.  the requirement to write a generic interfaces.

<P>
The main additional contruct allowed by the preprocessor is a dot notation, 
similar to that used in C++ and Eiffel.  The dot notation encourages the programmer
to think of the routines as ``methods'' which apply to the object at hand.
It should be stressed that the preprocessor is not <EM>neccesary</EM> to write in
an object-oriented Fortran95 style. It just makes the job easier.

<P>
The following sections describe the rules for valid input to <TT>foo</TT> preprocessor, and the actual transformation process
performed by the preprocessor. 

<P>
Although the rules are quite simple, and examples are given,
it is probably easier to examine <TT>foo</TT> modules that have already been
written. It should be possible to understand <TT>foo</TT> code
without reading the formal rules, if you already have
a basic knowledge of object-oriented techniques.
