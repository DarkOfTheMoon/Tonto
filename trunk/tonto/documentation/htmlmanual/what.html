<P>This depends on whether you are a user or a programmer.

<P>As a user, you can do the following types of calculations:

<UL>
<LI>Hartree-Fock molecular calculations of all types except general restricted
Hartree-Fock, using gaussian basis sets.
</LI>
<LI>Density plots of various kinds:
charge, spin, orbital, current, solenoidal current, irrotational current,
electric potential, and ELF density plots, Fermi mobility function plots
for all types of gaussian basis sets, density matrices.
</LI>
<LI>Vibrationally averaged density plots, as above, for diatomics.
</LI>
<LI>Mulliken and Roby population analyses.
</LI>
<LI>Decomposition of the SCF energy into orbital and orbital pair
contributions.
</LI>
<LI>Elastic X-ray and PND scattering intensities calculated from
non-interacting Hartree-Fock molecular wavefunctions in any spacegroup.
</LI>
<LI>Elastic X-ray and PND scattering intensity statistics, such as qq-plots,
and angle / intensity dependence of the z deviation.
</LI>
<LI>Non-interacting Hartree-Fock molecular wavefunctions fitted to X-ray and
PND scattering data in any spacegroup.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>As a programmer, you have html access to comprehensive online documentation
for every module.  The modules available define types which deal with the
following issues:

<UL>
<LI>Error handling, memory management, call-stack management, and timing.
</LI>
<LI>Basic type (integer, real, and string) manipulation.
</LI>
<LI>Vectors, matrices, and multidimensional arrays of all types.
</LI>
<LI>Binary, text, and archive files.
</LI>
<LI>Gaussian basis functions, shells, shell pairs and quartets,
basis sets, including integrals.
</LI>
<LI>Rectilinear grids.
</LI>
<LI>Pointgroups symmetry including irreps.
</LI>
<LI>Crystal (spacegroup) symmetry and unit cells.
</LI>
<LI>DIIS extrapolation for vectors and matrices.
</LI>
<LI>Atoms and molecules.
</LI>
</UL>
