<H1>An Overview of TONTO</H1>

<P>TONTO is a computer package for ``doing'' computational chemistry.  It is
the embodiment of a more grandiose scheme to make computational chemistry
cheaper, easier, and more fun to do. 

<P>The idea is to provide useful, well documented and efficient ``blocks'' of
code that can easily be ``put together'' in as many ways as the user can
imagine.

<P>TONTO is copyleft under the less restrictive GNU library license.  It is
officially, and forever, free software.

<P>This document is a complete introduction and manual to the TONTO system.  It
is suitable for beginners and experts, users and programmers.  To get some idea
of whether TONTO may be of any use to you, and to understand how to use it, you
should at least read this chapter.

<H1><A NAME="purpose">The purpose of TONTO</A></H1>

<P>The name TONTO<A NAME="foot1a" HREF="#foot1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> means ``idiot''
in Spanish, since one of the main aims of TONTO is to be simple.  More
specifically, the main aims of TONTO are, in order of priority:

<UL>
<LI>To provide useful tools for computational chemistry
</LI>
<LI>To be simple to use, understand, maintain, and modify
</LI>
<LI>To be efficient
</LI>
</UL>

<P>It must be kept in mind that computational chemistry calculations are
usually very time consuming. Thus, the objective of simplicity may be in
conflict with the objective of efficiency. Getting the balance between these
two issues is always tricky. In general, for TONTO, if it is not possible to
have both simplicity and a high degree of efficiency, we will choose
simplicity.

<H1><A NAME="who">Who is TONTO for?</A></H1>

<P>TONTO is intended mainly for computational chemists with new ideas, but who
are discouraged by the time it might take to understand and modify old,
monolithic programs to do what they want.  You don't have to reinvent the wheel
to program in TONTO.

<P>Although TONTO is for the people who mainly write code, it is still very
easy to use for the novice.
