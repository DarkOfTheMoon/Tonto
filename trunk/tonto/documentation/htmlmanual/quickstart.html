</CENTER>

<P>Download the latest version of TONTO from the <A
HREF="http://www.theochem.uwa.edu.au/tonto/download.html">download page</A>.

<P>To unpack the archive you downloaded, type:
<DIR><PRE>gunzip -c tonto.tar.gz | tar xvf -</PRE></DIR>

<P>Then to compile and install Tonto, type:
<DIR> <PRE>
cd tonto
./configure
make install
</PRE></DIR>

<P>"configure" may tell you to edit a specific file in the site_config
directory which contains default settings.<BR>
If this is the case, it is because "configure" does not know which options to
set for the compiler on your system.  See the <A
HREF="site_config.html">site_config</A> documentation.

<P>You may want to have a look at the site_config file that "configure" tells
you anyway, just to check the compiler settings.

<P>Some compilers may need upgrading or require special settings.  Have a look
at the <A HREF="problems.html#compspec">compiler specific issues</A> page for these.
