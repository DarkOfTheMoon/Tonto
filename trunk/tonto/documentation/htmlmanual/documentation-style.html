the available documentation.</P><P>Since TONTO is primarily aimed at programers, the documentation is
geared toward them.</P><P>The documentation is comprised of two parts---the short and long
documentation.  Both parts are extracted directly from the <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> code.  The
short documentation is comprised of routine names with their documentation and
variable declarations immediately afterwards; data components are also
documented in a similar style. The body of the routine is not displayed.  The
long documentation is comprised of the entire <span class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> code.</P><P>In both the long and short documentation, it is possible to to traverse
the call-tree by hyperlinks, simply by clicking on underlined items. This can
save much time when learning or remembering how an algorithm works.</P><P>Although both data and routines are accessed in the same way, by a dot
notation, the documentation distinguished by colour those that are data (in
green), and those that are routines (in red). Since efficiency is a prime goal
of TONTO, it is hoped that the presence of many &#8220;<span class="quote">red</span>&#8221; routines in
a hot loop would warn the programmer of any efficiencies.</P><P>A well written TONTO routine is short, and has a clear purpose which is
reflected in its name. In order that the purpose of the routine is quite clear,
its name can sometimes be quite long, and it will often use the underscore
character.  We hope that most routines in TONTO are well written.</P><P>There are a few other essential conventions: specifically, the first
argument to every routine has the name <tt class="literal">self</tt> and is of the
same type as the module it belongs to. In this way, the language is very similar
to Python, for example.</P><P>The <tt class="literal">self</tt> variable is not explicitly seen in the
documentation, or the <tt class="literal">foo<tt class="literal"> code but its presence can be
inferred by entities which begin with a dot, e.g.  </tt>.name</tt>  is
the component <tt class="literal">name</tt> of the self variable.</P></div><div class="navfooter"><IMG SRC="../hr.png" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100%"><BR><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="foo.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="writing-programs.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="conventional-routines.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The foo language in TONTO </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Conventional routines</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
