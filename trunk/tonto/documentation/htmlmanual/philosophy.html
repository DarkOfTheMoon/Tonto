becoming mainly an organizational one, of joining the appropriate and different
methodology together in flexible ways. We recognise this and it underlies the
whole structure of TONTO.</P><P>It is also our view that the great advances in computer software that have
been made over the last decades are due mainly to the free exchange of ideas and
information, including the availability of good free software. </P><P>Theoretical chemists, and quantum chemists in particular, are noted for
their strong ethic of <span class="emphasis"><em>standardizing</em></span> the quality of
theoretical calculations for predicting experimental quantities.  Sadly, it
seems the ethic to standardize and share the code required for computational
chemistry is fast vanishing.  A number of reasons can be posited for this, some
of which are discussed below.  Whatever the reason, it is clear that the lack of
cooperation between researchers in computational chemistry has had, and will
continue to have a deleterious effect on the important role that computation
should be taking in chemistry.</P><P>The immediate effect of this is felt by students with fresh ideas, but who
spend endless hours doing what many other have done before them.  This is enough
to put many people off new methods development---which is at the heart of
computational chemistry.</P></div><div class="navfooter"><IMG SRC="../hr.png" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100%"><BR><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="module-shell4.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cooperation.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The SHELL4 module </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Cooperation: naiveté or just good sense?</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
