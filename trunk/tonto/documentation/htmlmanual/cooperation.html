naive.</P><P>Let's rebutt common reasons against sharing code in a standard
format:</P><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>Sharing code won't work, hardly anyone writes
code</em></span>.  The bulk of new computer code  is written by students or
post-docs.  People like you, who are reading this manual. A simple calculation
will show that there are a large number of you who are isolated and do not
belong to a &#8220;<span class="quote">famous</span>&#8221; group with in-house codes.  Even more people
would write code if they knew it could be easy.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>My problem is unique, no one else would write anything
like the code that I need for my problem</em></span>.  It would be hard to
believe, given the number of people out there.  At the very least, you problem
might be broken down into parts which have been coded already.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>Sharing code won't work, no one can maintain a huge
package without being paid</em></span>.  That is not true; All that is required
is ongoing demand for the packages features, and that comes down to you. If you
need the package for something, then you will service it so it works for you.
There is plenty of evidence that free packages can survive and develop. Linux
and gcc are examples.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>It requires an expert to write computational chemistry
codes</em></span>.  Again, a fallacy. Only some parts require experts. Anyone can
write a Hartree-Fock program if they have a routine that gives them integrals.
And anyway, the parts that require experts (like, for example, integrals) are
mainly written by students or post-docs who are supervised by
experts.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>What counts is writing papers, not standardized
share-able code</em></span>.  You are being inconsistent. Papers are a standard
way of sharing knowledge.  When the knowledge is based on new code, that should
be shared too.  In any case, you can write more papers if you save time by using
someone else's code.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>It would be quicker to use an existing package
developed in our group</em></span>.  Are you sure? It may take you a while to
understand someone else's coding style, and many packages are a hotch-potch
resulting from a number of authors work.  To write code as quickly as possible,
it is makes sense to use something already written and well documented. Let's
face it, you would use Mathematica if it was quick enough, but it isn't. And if
your project changes slightly, you have more options within a large shared
package.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>Someone will scoop my publication if I share my
code</em></span>.  Wait a while before you share the code. You won't be working
on this topic all your life. In the end, you will get <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span>
citations if you share your code.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>I want to make money</em></span>.  Unless you belong to
Gaussian, or Wavefunction, it isn't going to happen.  The market is saturated,
and the clients are poor and smart enough to write their own.  In any case, the
number employees in these companies is dwarfed by the number of students and
post-docs around the world who would share their code if they thought they could
get something in return.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>Sharing code is bad, you will never need to write code
from scratch and thus the code will never be independently verified</em></span>.
Sharing well documented code makes it open to checking without having to
laboriously re-do everything from scratch.  Greater scrutiny by greater numbers
of people make ity more likely that inconsistencies will appear.  Ultintmately,
the responsibility for code correctness rests with the author. All of us have
used programs, even if only hand calculators, without checking the code for
them.</P></li><li><P><span class="emphasis"><em>Sharing code is a waste of time, I can't understand
what others write</em></span>.  It might be true, which is why its important to
have a simple, consistent coding style, good documentation, good error checking,
and good examples of share-able code.  I believe that TONTO is a good example
of this. With these mechanisms in place, it becomes hard to write bad. If your
contributed code is useful for others, it will become debugged and easier to
understand as features are added.</P></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><IMG SRC="../hr.png" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100%"><BR><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="philosophy.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="philosophy.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="final-word.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 14. The underlying philosophy of TONTO </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Final word</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
