To add a job to the test suite do the following:

1. Make a directory describing the test job (please, use 
   a good descriptive name, since these jobs can serve
   as examples)

2. Copy your "stdin" and "stdout" files to the test directory.
   Also copy any additional input you need, or additional 
   output that you want checked, to the test directory.

3. If you have aditional input or output, then create a file 
   "IO" which contains a list of the additional input and 
   output files, e.g.

   input: extra_input_file1
   input: extra_input_file2
   output: extra_output_file1
   output: extra_output_file2

   Do not include "stdin" and "stdout", they are assumed to 
   be the default input and output.
