To add a job to the test suite
------------------------------

1. Make a directory describing the test job.
   Use a good long descriptive name.

2. Copy your "stdin" and "stdout" files to this test job
   directory.  Also copy there any additional input files you 
   need, or additional output files that you want checked.

3. If you have aditional input or output, then create a file 
   "IO" which contains a list of the additional input and 
   output files, e.g.

   input: extra_input_file1
   input: extra_input_file2
   output: extra_output_file1
   output: extra_output_file2

   Do not include "stdin" and "stdout", they are assumed to 
   be the default input and output.

4. Now you can do "make tests" in the top directory and your 
   test job will be executed.

5. If everything is OK, add it into the repository.

NOTES
-----

* In your "stdin" input file you probably should include the line

  output_style_options= { real_precision= 4 }

  which will ensure all real numbers are output to only 4 decimal
  places. This decreases the chance of a failure due to small
  numerical errors.

* If a test job fails, a file "stdout.bad" will appear containing
  the results of the failed job. Likewise for any extra output 
  files you specified. You can always copy "stdout.bad" over the
  old "stdout" file if you are happy that the output is correct.

* Please add tests liberally, since they may serve as examples
  of how to use your program.

* Curious about how it works? See "perform_tests.pl" and 
  "compare_output.pl" in the scripts directory.
